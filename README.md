# Details
A series of mods made for Shadow of War based on the Middle Earth Mod Loader and its API.

Descriptions for each individual mod can be found below.

## Installation
All mods require the [**Middle Earth Mod Loader**](https://github.com/ReaperAnon/Middle-Earth-Mod-Loader).

Download any of the mods you'd like to use from the **Releases** section [**here**](https://github.com/ReaperAnon/Shadow-Of-War-Mods/releases/tag/1.0.0) and place the contents of the archive (download [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/a/7z2301-x64.exe) to open the archives if you have no archiving application) into the **"plugins"** folder next to **"ShadowOfWar.exe"** in your game's installation folder.

If you don't have a **"plugins"** folder yet, simply **create a new folder and rename it**.

The folder structure should look like this: **"...\steamapps\common\ShadowOfWar\x64\plugins"**

## Mods
### Autocomplete Item Challenges
Automatically completes item challenges and lets you upgrade all weapons with secondary abilities at any time.

### Cheat Hotkeys
Adds a set of hotkeys to enable god mode, infinite arrows, might, focus, wrath and mission timers.

Configurable in-game.

### Elven Speed
Reworks the focus cost of the elven speed ability and lets you define your focus regeneration rate while using it. By default it's set to pause focus regen instead of draining it like in vanilla.

Configurable in-game.

### FOV Extender
Extends the game's field of view beyond its maximum value.

Configurable in-game.

### Improved Ice Storm
Improves the mandatory Ice Storm still so it doesn't count as a straight downgrade or at best a sidegrade. You can use normal attacks to damage frozen enemies like in the DLCs or use the wraith flurry attack on demand when desired instead of needlessly being dragged into slow animation with long recovery in the middle of combat.

Can also use the regular wraith stun which simply stuns enemies instead of freezing them, making it still useful against enemies who are either immune to or enraged by frost.

Configurable in-game.

### Indomitable Hitstreaks
Being hit will no longer reset your hitstreak while in combat.

### Mounted Might Multiplier
Increases the amount of might gained when fighting while mounted on creatures. Makes it feel like less of a downgrade to hop on a caragor, as creatures are rather niche and not that useful later in the game for anything except cheesing enemies. 

Configurable in-game.

### Multi-Equip Skills
Lets you equip multiple skill upgrades with a modifier key instead of being forced to only ever have just one.

Configurable in-game.

### Myrian Loss Multiplier
Changes the amount of myrian lost. Doesn't change the cost requirements, only the amount that you lose when you purchase upgrades or anything else.

Configurable in-game.

### Orc Spawn Rarity
Grants two options to define an additional spawn chance for epic and legendary tier enemies that is calculated on top of the base game's system. Can make the game harder by spawning tougher orcs.

Configurable in-game.

### Skill Level Requirements
Removes skill level requirements so you can buy any skill at any level, making the early game more interesting.

### No Skill Prerequisites
Removes the requirement of having previous main skills in the skill tree. Lets you buy any main skill upgrade without forcing you to buy all the ones before it as well, making the eary game more interesting.

### No Skill Story Locks
Removes story-locked skills, allowing you to spend a point and unlock the skills before playing their prerequisite quests.

### Uruk Intel
Lets you remove the mystery orcs with a blacked out character model or alternatively lets you show all of their weaknesses as well from the start. Having all weaknesses uncovered can mess with some main quests and lock progression until that option is disabled and the quest is restarted.

Configurable in-game.
